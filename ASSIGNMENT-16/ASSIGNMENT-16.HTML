        Crayon-Shin chan (Japanese: クレヨンしんちゃん, Hepburn: Kureyon Shin-chan), also known as Shin Chan, is a 
        Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Yoshito Usui. It follows the adventures of the five-year-old 
        Shinnosuke "Shin" Nohara and his parents, 
        baby sister, dog, neighbours, and friends and is set in Kasukabe, Saitama Prefecture of Japan.

        Crayon Shin-chan first appeared in 1990 in a Japanese weekly magazine called Weekly Manga Action, which 
        was published by Futabasha. Due to the death of author Yoshito Usui, the manga in its original form ended on
         September 11, 2009. A new manga began in the summer of 2010 by members
         of Usui's team, titled New Crayon Shin-chan (新クレヨンしんちゃん, Shin Kureyon Shin-chan).
